# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## **Overview**
Pewlett Hackard is looking ahead at potential staffing changes due to upcoming retirements. Bobby is an analyst tasked with doing some employee research to determine how many staff will be retiring in the next few years and how many positions the company will need to fill due to those retirements. Generating this analysis will provide PH with a list of employees eligible for retirement packages. It will also provide them insight to upcoming staffing changes and give them the opportunity to be proactive in preparing to address vacancies created by the retirements. 

## **Results**
- *Initial analysis provides a list of potentially retiring employees based on their date of birth. This helps PH to determine which employees are coming up on retirement age  which will assist in determining how many positions or roles will need to be filled as these staff retire.*
- *Initial query analysis of title data shows many potential employees may no longer be employed by PH and thus should not be included in the final analysis.*

- *Further query analysis shows that the bulk of retirees looks to be staff in senior roles.*

- *Creating a query for future retirees, based again on date of birth, provides PH with a list of potential mentors to train incoming staff that will be replacing those that are retiring in the current year or years.*

## **Summary**
Based on the expected total of upcoming retirements (see image), there are upwards of 70,000 roles that will need to be filled as current employees begin the retiring process.

In comparison, the potential number of mentors is smaller than the number of retiring employees and as such, these mentors could be stretched very thin trying to help train new employees coming in to fill the vacancies left by the retirees.
